## Description

The Car Rental application is a mobile application coded in React Native, allowing users to rent a car directly through a phone, tablet, or mobile device. 
The application caters to different user roles. Unregistered users can view information about available cars and also have the option to register and log in. 
Users with the "Customer" role can make car reservations and manage their own user information. 
Additionally, the administrator of the Car Rental application has the capability to manage users, cars, reservations, and generate various reports via Web App(this is not available in Mobile Application). 
The use of React Native ensures cross-platform compatibility, allowing the application to be used seamlessly on different devices, such as phones, tablets, or other iphone devices.

## Features

- User authentication (Register/Login)
- Browse available cars
- Make car reservations
- View and manage user account information
- Admin functionalities for managing cars, users, and reservations(Web Version check Web App )


Since it is an Expo project, you can run the code on a virtual phone emulator or the web version (e.g., [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)). When you run
```bash
expo start
```
in the terminal, the application will start running.

## Backend Connection

The React Native Car Rental application establishes a secure backend connection to a server (with a Swagger Documention) to enable seamless communication between the mobile app and the server. 
This connection is utilized for user authentication, fetching and updating car information, managing reservations, and other crucial functionalities. 
Through well-defined API endpoints, the frontend interacts with the backend to ensure a smooth and efficient user experience. 
This two-way communication enables real-time updates and data synchronization, providing users with accurate and up-to-date information within the Car Rental application.
